# College Predictor

- **Rank-Based Prediction:** Predicts potential colleges based on the user's ACPC rank.
- **Data Fetching:** Retrieves up-to-date data from the ACPC for accurate predictions.
- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for input and results.
- **Backend Integration:** Utilizes Django for backend processing and data management.
